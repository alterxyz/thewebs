## Tool List

### Chat with me (AI)

A chatbot powered by LLM and RAG, capable of answering your recruitment-related questions. It stays focused on "me" instead of going off-topic. Another key achievement is that this LLM can say "no" instead of always saying "yes" and fabricating information (in most cases).
Try asking it "You know Rust?"

### A-B Bot

- Provide an "initial task" as the context, then enter new tasks in the chatbox.

- Features: This AI has no memory, so it's always "context -> your input." This makes it faster and simpler.

Similar to ChatGPT, where you provide the **first** message as the "task brief" and ChatGPT responds with "Understood." Then you enter the **second** message. However, instead of entering a **third** message, you choose to `edit` the **second** message multiple times.

This bot functions in a similar way but is more straightforward and efficient.
